        <dc:title> 1938-2014 Data Set of Urban Extent Derived for Boise Idaho and Surrounding Region </dc:title>
        <dc:description>
            <p>This is a polygon data set representing the extent of urban development within areas
                of special interest in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding region. The data was derived
                from land parcel records available from the Ada and Canyon county assessors' offices
                and from the historic images and orthophotos available at the Boise State
                Library.</p> This dataset contains cadastral parcels in the form of a GIS layer
            populated with multiple attributes including land use type, property value, sales
            description, built date, legal description and ownership. We reclassified the parcels
            into six general land use categories: single-family residential (SFR), multi-family
            residential (MFR), commercial, industrial, institutional and open space. The SFR
            category in this study includes detached single family dwellings of all residential
            densities regardless of whether they are exurban (rural), suburban or urban residential.
            MFR, on the other hand, includes all attached dwellings including apartments, condos and
            townhouses. Since the major focus of the study was to explore general patterns of urban
            patches, we further reclassified the parcels into developed (urban) and undeveloped
            (non-urban) classes. We defined a parcel as developed if it has already been assigned a
            property tax value, has a built structure, and cannot be further developed. Sections of
            road and open space immediately adjacent to the developed parcels were captured so as to
            create urban patches by dissolving all the polygons touching to each other. Thus, we
            created urban extent maps for eight different years separated by an interval of about a
            decade: 1938, 1951, 1962, 1972, 1982, 1994, 2004 and 2014. The slight variation in the
            length of the interval owes to the availability of aerial images covering the whole
            study area. To delineate the urban extent for each of the eight study years, we used
            parcel attributes including construction date, property tax date, and subdivision permit
            date. In addition, we manually tallied the developed parcels with high resolution aerial
            images before finalizing the urban extent maps. Projected Coordinate System: NAD 1983
            Transverse Mercator. Attributes: Class = Urban or Non-urban (for each patch, and here
            all patches are urban); Dist = Distance to nearby patch. </dc:description>
